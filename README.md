# 🚨 Insurance Claims Fraud Detection
A data science project to detect fraudulent insurance claims using a machine learning model.

## 📊 Objective
Develop a predictive model to identify high-risk claims and assist insurance companies in minimizing fraud-related losses.

## 🧾 Dataset
- Source: insurance_claims_raw.xlsx
- Features: Customer info, policy details, claim amounts
- Target: `fraud_reported` (Yes/No)

## 🔧 Methods
- Data Cleaning & Imputation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Random Forest Classification
- Model Evaluation & Feature Importance

## 📈 Results
- Most impactful features: `total_claim_amount`, `injury_claim`, `policy_annual_premium`
- Random Forest gave decent classification results
- Visualizations included for clarity

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Fraudulent claims are associated with higher costs and longer policy durations
- Feature importance helps prioritize indicators for fraud detection
